    <div id="about">
        <p>AwwMageddon is a city destruction game created for my Game Design 325 class. <br>
            It was programmed using blueprints in Unreal Engine 5 with a team of 4 Programmers and 5 Artists. <br>
            This was my first time making a fully 3D game and it incorporated a lot of different elements to it. <br>
            The uniqueness of AwwMageddon is that the "Kaijuwu" you are controlling to destroy the city actually runs off of an AI behavior tree to make it's decisions for it.</p>
